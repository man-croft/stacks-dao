# Deployment State

Inventory of contract addresses and hashes per network. Update this after every deploy so the frontend and operations docs stay accurate.

## Addresses

| Network  | DAO Core | Treasury | Transfer Adapter | Governance Token |
|----------|----------|----------|------------------|------------------|
| simnet   | _tbd_    | _tbd_    | _tbd_            | _tbd_            |
| devnet   | _tbd_    | _tbd_    | _tbd_            | _tbd_            |
| testnet  | _tbd_    | _tbd_    | _tbd_            | _tbd_            |
| mainnet  | _tbd_    | _tbd_    | _tbd_            | _tbd_            |

## Notes
- Record contract hashes when available to support adapter hash verification.
- Keep deployment plans in `deployments/*.yaml` in sync with this inventory.
