# Backlog (Post-MVP)

Potential follow-ups after the MVP ships. Keep scope small and prioritize by impact.

## High impact
- Delegated voting UI with delegate roster and self-serve delegation
- Proposal templates for common actions (recurring transfers, adapter changes)
- Treasury analytics: inflow/outflow charts and balance history

## Prioritization approach
- Re-rank monthly using impact vs. effort; keep the top 3 items unblocked.
- Use small spikes to de-risk adapter registry changes before committing to builds.

## Medium impact
- Multisig-style execute fallback for stuck proposals
- Adapter registry UI and on-chain hash verification surface
- Notifications via webhooks/Discord for proposal lifecycle events

## Low impact / nice-to-have
- NFT-gated proposal types or role-based guards
- Basic analytics hooks (page views, connect rate) with privacy-safe tooling
- Theming system with light/dark presets and custom token sets
