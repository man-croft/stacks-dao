# Contributing

- Use conventional commits (e.g., `feat:`, `chore:`, `docs:`).
- Run `clarinet check` for contract changes and `npm test` for the Vitest suite when touching logic.
- Prefer small PRs (2-5 commits) scoped to one concern.
- Keep docs in `docs/` in sync with any new behavior or parameters.
